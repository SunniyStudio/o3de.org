The Android Project Generator (APG, for short) is a convenient tool that simplifies the generation of an Android project.

The APG is available via the Project Manager (aka _bin/profile/o3de.exe_) as a menu option for all **registered** projects:

And this is how the APG UI looks like:

A `README.md` file was added to explains how to use the tool:
